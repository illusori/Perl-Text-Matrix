Text-Matrix

Text::Matrix is a specialist table display module for display of
matrices of single-character (such as Y/N for yes/no) or short
multi-character data against row and column labels that are sufficiently
longer that conventional table layouts distort the layout of the data.

The core aim is to base the layout on the tabular data concisely and
formated regularly to reflect the terseness of the underlying data,
without being forced to compensate for the longer length of the
labels for the columns and rows.

Text::Matrix will also optionally split the matrix into several
sections based on width of the generated matrix, suitable for display
in situations where you don't want external line-wrapping to confuse
the layout.  (Display on an xterm, cut-n-paste into an email, etc.)
